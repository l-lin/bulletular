# Bulletular [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/l-lin/bulletular.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/l-lin/bulletular) [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/l-lin/bulletular.png?label=ready)](https://waffle.io/l-lin/bulletular) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/l-lin/bulletular.png)](https://gemnasium.com/l-lin/bulletular)

Bulletular is a TODO web application based on [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [AngularUI](http://angular-ui.github.io/).

Bulletular functionnalities is mainly based on [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) ideas of keyboard shortcuts for completing, removing, moving tasks. 

*Note: I use Workflowy everyday btw. I strongly recommend this application to organize thoughts/ideas/work*

# About this project

This project was created mainly for learning purpose.

I was just doing some practice with AngularJS and it was also the opportunity to test out the Github pages.

If you feel like you can do something out of it, go for it! Fork it and happy hacking! :)
